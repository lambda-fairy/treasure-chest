Treasure Chest
==============

An obsessively designed implementation of the board game, *Treasure
Chest*. Two players move their pieces in an attempt to grab the treasure
in the middle of the board.

This was an assignment for the COSC121 course at the University of
Canterbury. It was probably beyond what was expected for a first year
course, but it was fun to write nevertheless.
